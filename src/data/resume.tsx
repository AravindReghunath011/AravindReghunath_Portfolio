  summary:
    "After high school, I decided to take the road less traveled. Instead of diving into a traditional degree, I rolled up my sleeves and taught myself the ins and outs of full-stack development. I fell in love with the MERN stack and honed my skills by building my own projects from the ground up. It's been a journey of late-night coding sessions, countless 'aha!' moments, and the thrill of seeing my ideas come to life on screen. While I may not have a fancy diploma, I've got a portfolio of real-world projects that showcase what I can do. I'm proof that with passion and determination, you can carve your own path in the tech world.",
